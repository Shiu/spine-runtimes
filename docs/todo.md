- Generate language bindings from spine-cpp-lite
    - Create a TypeScript-based generator that takes spine-cpp-lite.h and generates:
        - Swift bindings (matching current spine-ios output from spine-cpp-lite-codegen.py)
        - Dart high-level wrapper (matching current manually-written spine_flutter.dart)
    - Should support language-specific customizations and special cases
    - Parse spine-cpp-lite.h using tree-sitter-c
    - Handle type conversions and memory management patterns for each language
