- SkeletonBinary.cpp is buggy. DataInput sign handling seems to be foo bar, so we get incorrect flags etc. Compare to SkeletonBinary.java, both statically (compare sources and involved classes) and dynamically (instrument both, run on same file, compare where we go wrong)
- clean up logging in spine-c/codegen, use chalk to do colored warnings/errors and make logging look very nice and informative (no emojis)
- spine-c/codegen type extractor should also report typedefs like typedef long long PropertyId; so primitive type to some name, and we need to handle that in the codegen
- Generate language bindings in spine-c/codegen
    - Use CClassOrStruct, CEnum that get generated from spine-cpp-types.json and generate
