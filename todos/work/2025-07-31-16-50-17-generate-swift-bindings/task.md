# Generate bindings for Swift from spine-c
**Status:** InProgress
**Agent PID:** 46440

## Original Todo
Generate bindings for Swift from spine-c generate() like dart-writer.ts

## Description
Create a TypeScript-based Swift bindings generator that uses the spine-c codegen infrastructure to generate idiomatic Swift code. The generator will replace the existing Python-based generator and produce type-safe Swift wrappers around the spine-c API, similar to how the Dart generator works. It will generate classes with proper inheritance hierarchy, nullability annotations, memory management, and maintain compatibility with the existing Swift API while adding modern Swift features.

## SpineSwift Module Implementation - COMPLETED & TODO

### Current Module Structure (COMPLETED)
We successfully restructured the spine-ios modules into three clean layers:

1. **SpineC** (✅ WORKING)
   - Location: `spine-ios/Sources/SpineC/`
   - Contains: Symlinks to spine-c and spine-cpp
   - Purpose: Compiles C/C++ sources, exposes C API to Swift
   - Status: Fully functional, tests pass

2. **SpineSwift** (⚠️ PARTIAL - has Objective-C conflicts)
   - Location: `spine-ios/Sources/SpineSwift/`
   - Contains:
     - `Generated/` - All generated Swift bindings from codegen
     - `Extensions/` - Platform-agnostic helper functions
   - Purpose: Swift bindings + high-level API (like spine_dart.dart)
   - Status: Generated but has Objective-C selector conflicts

3. **SpineiOS** (✅ RESTRUCTURED)
   - Location: `spine-ios/Sources/SpineiOS/`
   - Contains: iOS-specific UI components only
   - Files: SpineUIView, SpineController, SkeletonDrawableWrapper, etc.
   - Purpose: iOS-specific rendering and UI integration
   - Status: Cleaned up, old Generated folder removed

### What We Accomplished
- [x] Created proper module separation (SpineC, SpineSwift, SpineiOS)
- [x] Set up SpineC with symlinks to spine-c and spine-cpp
- [x] Updated Package.swift with correct target dependencies
- [x] Updated codegen to output to SpineSwift/Generated
- [x] Generated Swift bindings with proper imports
- [x] Created SpineSwift.swift with basic helper functions (loadAtlas, loadSkeletonData)
- [x] Removed SpineModule (redundant re-export module)
- [x] Fixed test package to use SpineC directly
- [x] Created skeleton_drawable_test.swift ported from Dart
- [x] Cleaned up test folder structure (removed accidental spine-ios subfolder)
- [x] Test successfully runs using SpineC module

### Known Issues
1. **SpineSwift has Objective-C selector conflicts**
   - Methods like `copy()` conflict with NSObject
   - Constructor `init(_:)` conflicts in inheritance hierarchies
   - Need to either rename methods or remove @objc annotations

2. **Swift Package Manager limitation**
   - Cannot mix C/C++ and Swift in same target
   - Must keep SpineC and SpineSwift as separate modules

### Major Swift Codegen Rewrite (Session 2 - COMPLETED)

We completely rewrote the Swift code generator to fix fundamental architectural issues. The rewrite reduced compilation errors from 61,503 to ~17,500.

#### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Pointer Management**
   - Root classes have `public let _ptr: UnsafeMutableRawPointer` field
   - Subclasses inherit `_ptr` from parent, no redeclaration
   - All C function calls cast `_ptr` inline: `_ptr.assumingMemoryBound(to: spine_xxx_wrapper.self)`
   - No computed properties, no `nativePtr`, no `ptr` - just `_ptr`

2. **Initialization Pattern**
   ```swift
   // Root class
   public init(fromPointer ptr: spine_timeline) {
       self._ptr = UnsafeMutableRawPointer(ptr)
   }
   
   // Subclass - cast to parent type
   public init(fromPointer ptr: spine_alpha_timeline) {
       super.init(fromPointer: UnsafeMutableRawPointer(ptr).assumingMemoryBound(to: spine_curve_timeline1_wrapper.self))
   }
   ```

3. **Single Inheritance + Protocols**
   - Swift doesn't support multiple inheritance
   - Use single base class + protocol conformance (like Dart's mixins)
   - Example: `class AlphaTimeline: CurveTimeline1, SlotTimeline`
   - Protocols don't override properties - each class provides its own implementation

4. **Property Synthesis**
   - Merged getter/setter pairs into single properties
   - Fixed duplicate property declarations in protocols
   - Handled Swift reserved words with backticks

5. **Type Conversions**
   - Objects passed as parameters: `obj._ptr.assumingMemoryBound(to: spine_xxx_wrapper.self)`
   - Enums: `spine_mix_blend(rawValue: UInt32(swiftEnum.rawValue))`
   - size_t parameters: `Int(value)`
   - Return values: Cast C pointers back to Swift wrapper types

6. **No Objective-C Integration**
   - Removed all @objc annotations
   - Removed NSObject inheritance
   - Fixed method name conflicts (copy, etc.)

#### What Works Now
- [x] AlphaTimeline compiles without errors
- [x] Proper inheritance hierarchy established
- [x] Pointer management is clean and consistent
- [x] Protocol conformance working correctly
- [x] Enum conversions functional

#### Remaining Issues (~17,500 errors)
- Casting between related pointer types in polymorphic scenarios
- Some enum return type conversions
- Array type handling in some edge cases
- RTTI-based instantiation needs refinement

### Progress Summary (Session 3)

#### Compilation Error Reduction
- **Starting errors**: ~17,500
- **Current errors**: ~9,720  
- **Total reduction**: ~7,780 errors (44.5% reduction)

#### Fixes Applied
1. **Protocol conformance issues** ✅
   - Modified `data` property in constraint classes to return protocol type for proper conformance
   - Added special handling for covariant return types in Swift protocols

2. **RTTI-based instantiation** ✅
   - Fixed pointer casting using `UnsafeMutableRawPointer` for concrete type instantiation
   - Updated all RTTI switch statements to properly cast abstract pointers to concrete types

3. **Enum value parsing** ✅
   - Fixed parsing of bit-shifted enum values (e.g., `1 << 0`, `1 << 1`)
   - Property enum now has correct values (1, 2, 4, 8, etc.) instead of all being 1

4. **Int32 vs Int conversions** ✅
   - Properly mapped `size_t` to `Int` instead of `Int32`
   - Fixed ~1,666 type conversion errors

5. **Array pointer conversions** ✅
   - Added `assumingMemoryBound` casting for all array operations
   - Fixed ~2,400 array-related compilation errors
   - Updated array methods to use proper Int types for indices and counts

6. **Enum return type conversions** ✅
   - Fixed conversion from C enum types to Swift enums
   - Added proper `.rawValue` extraction when needed

7. **Protocol `_ptr` declaration** ✅
   - Added `var _ptr: UnsafeMutableRawPointer { get }` to protocols
   - Enables polymorphic usage of conforming types in arrays and other contexts
   - Fixed ~31 errors related to protocol usage

8. **Improved constraint data handling** ✅
   - Extended fix to handle all constraint types (including Slider)
   - Properly returns protocol type `ConstraintData` for all constraint implementations
   - Fixed remaining protocol conformance issues

### TODO - High Priority
- [ ] Fix remaining ~9,720 compilation errors
- [ ] Investigate and categorize remaining error patterns
- [ ] Test full compilation of SpineSwift module
- [ ] Complete SpineSwift high-level API (port from spine_dart.dart)

- [ ] Complete SpineSwift high-level API (port from spine_dart.dart)
   - [ ] SkeletonDrawable class
   - [ ] AnimationStateEventManager
   - [ ] Bounds and Vector types
   - [ ] Skin extensions (getEntries)
   - [ ] BonePose coordinate transformations
   - [ ] Animation state listener management

- [ ] Create skeleton_drawable_test_swift to use SpineSwift API
   - Port skeleton_drawable_test_swift.swift which uses C bindings directly
   - Should test the high-level Swift API once working

### File Locations Reference
- Codegen: `spine-ios/codegen/src/swift-writer.ts`
- Generated output: `spine-ios/Sources/SpineSwift/Generated/`
- Test package: `spine-ios/test/`
- Test source: `spine-ios/test/src/skeleton_drawable_test.swift`

### Important Notes
- The test currently imports SpineC directly and works perfectly
- VS Code may show "no such module SpineC" but builds work fine (IDE issue)
- Generated files are in SpineSwift, NOT in SpineiOS
- SpineiOS should only contain iOS-specific UI components
- The symlinks in SpineC point to ../../../spine-c and ../../../spine-cpp
